ForceCommand           /bin/sh
PermitOpen             0.0.0.0
AllowTcpForwarding     no
PermitTunnel           no
# Subsystem sftp       /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
PermitUserEnvironment  no

I would instead determine what the user is likely to use it for. Because if there are only a few commands that you want them to have access to, I would instead remove the ability for them to even invoke a normal ssh shell.

AllowUsers             root
PermitRootLogin        forced-commands-only

PermitUserEnvironment  no

AllowTcpForwarding     no
PermitTunnel           no

# Subsystem sftp       /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
Subsystem smb-reload   /usr/bin/smbcontrol smbd reload-config
Subsystem status       /opt/local/bin/status.sh

ssh root@example -s smb-reload

If you find that you really do need to be able to run a normal shell, the most you really can hope for, is to slow them down, and make it more difficult.
